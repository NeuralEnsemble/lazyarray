Release 0.2.0
=============

* Fixed problems with deepcopying lazy arrays.
* Optimization - uses `x.min()` rather than `min(x)` where possible.
* Some fixes for when using boolean addressing.
* Setting shape on an larray now also sets it on all larrays within the operations list.
* Added `__eq__` method to larray.
* Replaced some assertions with more specific Exceptions.
* Added support for 'vectorized iterables', i.e. objects with a `next(n)` method so that you can return multiple values at once.
* Fixed some bugs when creating a lazy array from an existing lazy array.
* Added `dtype` attribute to `larray` class.


Release 0.2.1
=============

* Previous release didn't work with Python 3.


Release 0.2.2
=============

* Fixed behaviour of larray(VectorizedIterable) to match that of numpy array when indexing a single item.
* Pulled out `partial_shape()` and `full_address()` methods of `larray` as standalone functions.
* Better support for lists as masks.
* `larray`s are now callable, provided their `base_value` is callable and the argument is another `larray`.


Release 0.2.3
=============

* Support `numpy.int64` as indices.
* Better support for boolean indices.
* Handle the case of constant `larray`s of size 1.
