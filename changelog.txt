Release 0.2.0
=============

* Fixed problems with deepcopying lazy arrays.
* Optimization - uses `x.min()` rather than `min(x)` where possible.
* Some fixes for when using boolean addressing.
* Setting shape on an larray now also sets it on all larrays within the operations list.
* Added `__eq__` method to larray.
* Replaced some assertions with more specific Exceptions.
* Added support for 'vectorized iterables', i.e. objects with a `next(n)` method so that you can return multiple values at once.
* Fixed some bugs when creating a lazy array from an existing lazy array.
* Added `dtype` attribute to `larray` class.
